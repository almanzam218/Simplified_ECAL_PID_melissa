# Overview
This repository is a junction of SiWECAL and AHCAL simulations.
The starting point is the SiWECAL-Sim repository in https://github.com/marherje/SiWECAL-Sim but the structure has changed quite a lot to also leave space for the AHCAL analysis.

# Structure
- `Generation`: dd4hep sim of a combined geometry for both detectors.
- `Processors`: Marlin processors for MIP conversion, digitization, prepare ROOT files from the .slcio, etc.
- `Masking`: For ECAL masking of channels.
- `Analysis`: Anaylisis of the build files. Shower studies and PID.

## GENERATION
- `geometry`: Geometry .xml files. 
Includes original ECAL and AHCAL separate geometries of old simulations.
Includes the total geometry of 2022-06 TB with SiWECAL+AHCAL.
Includes a ILD-IDR scheme with an ECAL (30 layers) and AHCAL (48 layers) together
Note: The combined geometries are lead by one "compact" file that loads a 50x50x50m world and place the beam and detectors inside.
Beware of redefinitions inside the detectors geometries and overlapping of the geometries.
- `run_scripts`: Everything necessary to run the simulations by using the geometries in /geometry/.
### USEFUL CHECKS:
- `To visualize`:
"geoDisplay -compact compactgeometryfile.xml"

- `To check materials, distances and possible overlappings`:
"materialScan compactgeometryfile.xml x0 y0 z0 x1 y1 z1"
it will display a list of materials moving in a straight line from (x0,y0,z0) to (x1,y1,z1)

## PROCESSORS
- `ECAL processors`: Proccesing of from .slcio ECalorimetershits into "real" ECAL data.
- `HCAL processors`: Proccesing of from .slcio HCalorimetershits into "real" HCAL data. (TBD)
- `Joint processors`: (TBD)

## ANALYSIS
### `ECAL_Sim`: Shower and PID studies.
- `ShowerStudy`: Construction of variables, shower profile, Moli√®re radius, plots, etc.
- `PIDNTuples`: Optimized code for building the "ttree" for PID studies, includes histograms for all of them and macros to obtain plots. Includes macros for different PID scenarios (3 or 4 particles)
- `ML4PID`: Features a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) of hyper-parameters for a BDT-Based particle identification (PID). Requires the NTuples from PIDNTuples.
- `ML4PID/PSOforECALPID`: 3 categories (3 particles)
- `ML4PID/PSOforECALPID_4cat`: 4 categories (4 particles)
- `More TBD`
